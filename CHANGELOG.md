## [Unreleased] — branch `improve` (2026-06-11)

### Memory — loop-body value retention fixed (leak #1 residual)

- **`eval_block_discard`**: loop bodies (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`) no
  longer deep-extract and re-plant the value of the body's **last statement** into
  the loop's frame. Every loop caller discards that value, but the copy lived until
  the loop exited — so any loop whose last statement produced a compound
  (`arr = arr.map(...)`, `arr.reverse()`, …) retained one full copy **per
  iteration**. Measured: 300 iterations over a 20k-element array went from
  **~430 MB peak RSS to ~17 MB**. `return`/`throw` escaping the body keep the
  exact same extract+plant semantics as before.
- Probes refreshed (`mem_probe/`): the historic big leak (push-promotion in
  helpers, probes `f`/`h`) was already killed by the element-embedding refactor
  (`Array/Dict/Set` store `OwnedValue`, like `Instance`); global arena stays at
  baseline (~262 slots). Known minor residual: one small global slot per lambda
  **created** inside a loop (capture snapshot, ~24 bytes each).
- New regression test `unit_loop_body_value` (7 asserts): compound reassign /
  mutating method as last statement, return/throw from body, break/continue,
  do-while and foreach intact.

### Crypto — real signatures and CSPRNG (vetted crates)

- **`Crypto.randomBytes(n)`** — cryptographically secure random bytes from the OS
  entropy source (`getrandom` crate). Returns `[int]` (0..255). `n` capped at
  1 MB (throws beyond it; throws on `n < 1`). Unlike `Random.*` (seedable LCG,
  predictable — fine for games, never for secrets), this is safe for tokens,
  salts and keys.
- **`Crypto.ed25519Keypair()`** — generates an Ed25519 keypair
  (`ed25519-dalek` crate); returns `{ private, public }` as 64-char hex strings.
- **`Crypto.ed25519Sign(privateHex, message)`** — returns the 128-char hex
  signature. Deterministic (Ed25519 by design). Malformed/short keys throw.
- **`Crypto.ed25519Verify(publicHex, message, signatureHex)`** — `true`/`false`
  via strict verification (rejects non-canonical signatures). Malformed hex or
  wrong lengths throw; well-formed but invalid signatures return `false`.
- New tests: `unit_crypto_ed25519` (7) and `sec_crypto_ed25519` (8 — caps,
  malformed inputs, corrupted-signature behavior).

### Lexer

- New regression suite `unit_sci_notation` (7 asserts) cementing scientific
  notation (`1e-7`, `2.5e3`, `1E+10`, bare `e` still an identifier) — the
  feature itself shipped in 4.6.2.

---

## [5.0.0]

### GUI

- **`Gui.time()`**, **`Gui.drawRect(x, y, w, h, color)`**,
  **`Gui.fillCircle(cx, cy, r, color)`**, **`Gui.setImePosition(x, y)`** — drawing
  and IME surface for serez-ui (cursor blink timing, outlines, radio buttons,
  IME composition placement).

---

## [4.9.0]

### GUI

- **Font loading and selection**: `Gui.loadFont(path)` + proportional text
  rendering with real font metrics (replaces fixed-advance text).
- **`Gui.fillRoundRect(x, y, w, h, radius, color)`**.
- Error + security test coverage for the new Gui surface
  (`err_gui_*`, `sec_gui_no_permission`).

---

## [4.8.0]

### GUI — backend migration

- Backend migrated **minifb → winit + softbuffer + cosmic-text**: proper window
  lifecycle, IME support, real text shaping/rasterization, and the event model
  serez-ui's self-driven loop (`app.runGui`) builds on.

---

## [4.7.0]

### CLI

- **Run `.szx` (serez-ui JSX) files directly**: `sz app.szx` transpiles and runs
  without a separate step.

---

## [4.6.2]

### Lexer

- **Scientific notation in number literals**: `1e-7`, `2.5e3`, `1E+10`. The `e`
  is only consumed when followed by `[+-]?digit`, so identifiers like `e` keep
  lexing as before. (Unblocked BCE-style epsilon constants in serez-ai guides.)

### CLI

- **`sz run <name>` resolves package bin commands**: if `<name>` is not a script
  in `serez.json`, it resolves the entry of an installed package and forwards
  the remaining args (e.g. `sz run apipack build`).
- **Non-zero exit codes** on parse errors, runtime errors, and subcommand
  failures (CI-friendly).

---

## [4.6.0] — branch `improve`

### Package manager — dependency write-back

- **`sz install <pkg>`** now records the resolved dependency in `serez.json` (insert or update), so installing by command keeps the manifest in sync — matching the behavior of `npm install <pkg>` / `cargo add`. Previously the manifest was read-only and only `sz install` (no args) consumed it.
- **`sz uninstall <pkg>`** now removes the dependency from `serez.json` as well.
- The manifest edit is **surgical**: only the `dependencies` object is rewritten (canonical 2-space layout); `name`, `version`, `scripts`, `permissions` and the rest of the file's formatting are preserved verbatim. Brace matching honors `{`/`}` inside string values.
- `sz install` (no args, installs from the manifest) does **not** rewrite `serez.json`, so hand-written version specs are never clobbered.
- Manifest write failures are non-fatal: the package is already on disk, so the install/uninstall reports a warning instead of failing. With no `serez.json` present, `sz install` hints to run `sz init`.

### Tests

- 7 new Rust unit tests in `package_manager` (upsert into empty deps, append, update-in-place, insert missing `dependencies` key, preserve `scripts` block, brace-in-string handling, remove round-trip). Module suite: 14/14 pass.

---

## [4.5.0] — branch `core-websocket` → merged to `improve`

### WebSocket support (RFC 6455)

- **`Crypto.sha1(s)`** — SHA-1 hash, returns 40-char lowercase hex. Pure-Rust implementation, no external crates. Validated against RFC 3174 test vectors.
- **`Crypto.sha1base64(s)`** — SHA-1 followed by base64 encode of the raw digest. Used for the WebSocket handshake `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` key. Validated against the RFC 6455 §1.3 vector.
- **`Socket.recvWsFrame(conn_id)`** → `string | null` — decodes one WebSocket frame (RFC 6455): parses header, extended length, unmasks payload. Returns `null` on close frame.
- **`Socket.sendWsFrame(conn_id, data)`** → `null` — encodes `data` as an unmasked text frame (server → client) with correct 1-byte / 2-byte / 8-byte length encoding.
- **`Socket.listen(port)`** — now binds to `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`, allowing external connections (e.g. inside Docker via serez-apipack).

### WebSocket protocol hardening (5 bugs fixed)

- **DoS — unbounded payload** — a frame claiming `payload_len = 2^63` would allocate `vec![0; huge]` and crash. Now capped at `WS_MAX_PAYLOAD` (16 MiB), enforced on both the 1-byte and 8-byte extended-length paths before allocation.
- **Ping not answered** — `opcode=9` (ping) was returned as data. Real browsers close the connection on missing pong. Now auto-replies with `opcode=10` (pong) carrying the same payload, then loops to read the next data frame. Loop (not recursion) avoids stack overflow on repeated pings.
- **Close frame stream desync** — `opcode=8` returned before reading the close code + reason, leaving bytes in the TCP buffer that corrupted the next read. Now the payload is fully consumed before returning `null`.
- **RSV bits not validated** — RFC 6455 §5.2 requires RSV1/2/3 = 0 without a negotiated extension. Now rejects frames with any RSV bit set.
- **Invalid UTF-8 silently mangled** — text frames used `from_utf8_lossy` (replacing bad bytes with U+FFFD). RFC 6455 §5.7 requires an error. Now returns an error on invalid UTF-8. Control frames with payload > 125 bytes are also rejected (§5.5).

### Tests

- `unit_websocket` (13), `unit_sec_websocket` (13), `sec_websocket`, `54_websocket_e2e`, `55_websocket_integral`, `62_websocket_full_integral` (33 assertions), plus 8 Rust `ws_frame_tests`. Full suite: 327 `.sz` tests, 0 failures.

---

## [4.3.2] — branch `ai-deep` → merged to `improve`

### AI / Autodiff — Phase 1: Core training infrastructure

- **Optimizers** — `Autodiff.adamStep`, `adamwStep`, `sgdStep`, `rmspropStep`. All are pure functions that take current params + state and return `[new_param, new_state...]`. No tape side-effects.
- **Loss functions** — `Autodiff.mseLoss`, `maeLoss`, `bceLoss`, `crossEntropyLoss`. All tracked on the tape with correct backward passes.
- **Weight initialization** — `Autodiff.xavierUniform`, `xavierNormal`, `heUniform`, `heNormal`. Fan-in/fan-out computed automatically from shape (2D: `[out, in]`; 4D conv: `[cout, cin, kH, kW]`).
- **Gradient clipping** — `Autodiff.clipGrad(grad, max_norm)` per-tensor; `clipGradNorm(grads_array, max_norm)` global norm across a list of tensors.

### AI / Autodiff — Phase 2: Regularization & modern layers

- **BatchNorm** — `Autodiff.batchNorm(x, gamma, beta, training, [eps])`. Full backward: per-feature gradient for `gamma`, `beta`, and input. Input must be `[N, C]`.
- **Dropout** — `Autodiff.dropout(x, p, [training])`. Inverted dropout (divides by keep_prob in forward). Mask saved for backward. `training=false` → no-op.
- **Embedding** — `Autodiff.embedding(indices, weight)`. Gathers rows from `[vocab, emb_dim]` weight. Backward scatters gradients back to touched rows. `vocab_size` stored in `TapeOp` to avoid inference issues.
- **New activations (all tracked):**
  - `t.elu([alpha])` — ELU with correct `alpha * exp(x)` backward
  - `t.swish()` / `t.silu()` — swish with `(sigmoid + x*sigmoid*(1-sigmoid))` backward; stores both `x` and `sigmoid(x)`
  - `t.mish()` — mish with `tanh(sp) + x*sech²(sp)*sigmoid(x)` backward
  - `t.gelu()` — GELU now tracked with full `d/dx` backward (was untracked before)
  - `t.leaky_relu(alpha)` — now tracked (was untracked before)
- **AvgPool2d** — `t.avg_pool2d(kernel, stride)`. Uniform gradient distribution in backward.
- **Tensor utilities** — `.variance()`, `.std()`, `.cumsum()`, `.softplus()`, `.hardsigmoid()`, `.hardswish()`

### AI / Autodiff — Phase 3: N-D operations & performance

- **Shape manipulation** — `t.unsqueeze(dim)`, `t.squeeze()`, `t.squeeze(dim)`, `t.permute([axes])` (full N-D generalized transpose)
- **N-D broadcasting** — `t.broadcastTo([shape])`, `t.broadcastAddNd(other)`, `t.broadcastMulNd(other)`. Full numpy semantics for arbitrary dimensions.
- **Batch matmul** — `t.bmm(other)`: `[B,N,M] @ [B,M,K] → [B,N,K]`
- **N-D reduce** — `t.reduceSum(axis)`, `t.reduceMean(axis)`, `t.reduceMax(axis)` for any tensor dimension
- **Element-wise ops** — `t.sign()`, `t.reciprocal()`, `t.sin()`, `t.cos()`, `t.round()`, `t.floor()`, `t.ceil()`, `t.maximum(other)`, `t.minimum(other)`
- **stopGrad / detach** — `t.stopGrad()`, `t.detach()`, `Autodiff.stopGrad(tensor)` — returns a copy disconnected from the tape

### AI / Autodiff — Weight persistence

- **`Autodiff.saveWeights(path, tensors)`** — saves an array of tensors to a `.szw` binary file (magic `SZWT` + version + count + per-tensor: ndim, shape, data as f64 LE)
- **`Autodiff.loadWeights(path)`** — reads `.szw` and returns `Array` of tensors in the same order. Full round-trip precision (float64).

### Autodiff bug fixes

- **`TapeOp::BroadcastMul` backward** — was incomplete (only accumulated gradient to `mat_id`, skipped `rhs_id`). Now saves both `mat_data` and `rhs_data` in forward, computes `d_mat` and `d_rhs` correctly.
- **`TapeOp::Swish` backward** — was reconstructing `x` from `sigmoid(x)` via logit (numerically unstable). Now stores `cached_input` alongside `cached_sigmoid`.
- **`TapeOp::Gelu`** — GELU was not tracked at all. Added `TapeOp::Gelu` with correct backward.
- **`leaky_relu`** — was not recorded on the tape. Now records `TapeOp::LeakyRelu`.
- **`TapeOp::Embedding`** — backward was inferring vocab size heuristically. Now stores `vocab_size` explicitly in the op.
- **`TapeOp::Swish` shape** — added `cached_input: Vec<f64>` field to the variant.

### Dict bug fix (B-31 complete)

- **Typed dict missing-key access** — `d["missing"]` on a `<string, int>` dict was still throwing `❌ ERROR: Key not found in typed dict` instead of returning `null`. The B-31 fix was only applied to `value_type == "any"` dicts. Now all dicts return `null` for missing keys regardless of type annotation.
- **`dict["key"].push(val)` writeback** — calling mutating array methods on a value retrieved from a dict (`grupos["pares"].push(n)`) now writes the modified array back to the dict automatically. Previously the modification was silently discarded.
- **`plant` → `plant_global`** for dict value access — prevents dangling refs when the dict lives in an outer scope.

### Package manager

- **`sz init`** — creates a `serez.json` interactively in the current directory. Prompts for name (default: folder name), version, description, author.
- **`sz init --y`** — non-interactive: uses folder name as project name, all defaults, no prompts.
- **`sz run <script>`** — reads `serez.json` and executes the named script entry (e.g. `sz run dev` → runs `sz index.sz`). Reports error with available scripts if name not found.
- **`scripts` field in `serez.json`** — new manifest field, parsed alongside `dependencies` and `permissions`.

### stdout flush fix

- **`stdout` buffer** — `run_file()` now explicitly flushes `stdout` before returning. On Windows, large output from the spawned interpreter thread could appear after the shell prompt due to unflushed buffered writes. Regression test: `49_stdout_flush` (200 output lines).

### Test count

- **321 passing** (0 failing) across E2E, unit, error, security, AI, CLI, and package manager tests.
- New test files: `ai_phase1_training.sz`, `ai_phase2_layers.sz`, `ai_phase3_ops.sz`, `ai_weights_persistence.sz`, `49_stdout_flush.sz`.

---

## [4.1.2] — branch `improve`

### Package manager

- `sz init` / `sz run` / `scripts` field (see v4.3.2 above — backfilled from ai-deep merge)

---

## [4.0.1] — branch `improve`

### Networking / stdlib

- **Default `User-Agent`** — `fetch` now sends `User-Agent: Serez-Code/<version>` unless the caller sets one in `headers`. Without it, ureq sends `ureq/x.y`, which some CDNs/WAFs answer with `503`; an identifiable UA avoids those spurious failures. A caller-provided `User-Agent` always wins. (`src/evaluator/builtins.rs`, `eval_fetch`.)

### JSON

- **`JSON.pretty(value, [indent])`** — pretty-prints values as indented JSON (default **2** spaces per level; `0` falls back to compact). When given a raw JSON string — such as a `fetch` response body — it parses it first and re-indents, so `JSON.pretty(fetch(url))` prints formatted output directly; non-JSON strings are kept as-is. `JSON.stringify` is unchanged (still compact, single-line). Implemented in `src/evaluator/mod.rs` (`json_pretty_owned` / `json_pretty_inner`) + `src/evaluator/namespaces.rs`.

### Docs

- Documented the `fetch` HTTP client (signature, default headers incl. the new `User-Agent`, options dict, `full`/`binary` modes, throw-on-4xx/5xx) and `JSON.pretty` in `README.md` and the serez-code-page builtins page.

### Fixes

- **`unit_native_fns.sz` parsing** — the POST test embedded a JSON body with an unescaped `{`, which serez treats as string-interpolation start. That silently aborted parsing of the rest of the file, so the POST test (and any added after it) never ran while the runner still reported the file as passing (parser errors go to stderr; the runner only greps stdout for `[FAIL]`). Escaped as `\{` so the whole file parses and executes.
- **`43_fetch_full_e2e` flakiness** — the test hit httpbin.org, which intermittently returns 503; since `full` mode does not throw on HTTP status, a 503 left `status="unknown"` and the test failed. Switched the endpoint to PokeAPI (`/api/v2/pokemon/ditto`) — a stable, CDN-backed service that consistently returns 200 — and tightened the assertions to check the *real* response (`status == 200`, `ok == true`, `statusText`/`headers` present, body contains `ditto`), so it actually exercises status-line/header/body parsing. Still degrades gracefully (`network_error`) on a genuine outage.

### Test count

- 310 passing (0 failing) — added `unit_json_pretty` (10 `JSON.pretty` cases) and two `fetch` User-Agent tests in `unit_native_fns`.

---

## [4.0.0] — branch `improve`

### Networking / stdlib

- **`fetch` is now a complete general-purpose HTTP client.** Previously `fetch(url, [method], [body])` always sent a hardcoded `Content-Type: application/json`, had a fixed 10 s timeout, threw on any status ≥ 400 (discarding the response body), only supported GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, and corrupted binary responses via `from_utf8_lossy`. It now accepts an optional **options dict** after the url — `fetch(url, [method], [body], options)` — where `options` is a serez dict (e.g. `({"full", true})`):
  - `headers` — a `<string, string>` dict of request headers (enables `Authorization`, `Accept`, cookies, custom headers, …). Names/values containing control chars (`\n` `\r` `\0`) are rejected to prevent CRLF / header injection. A user-set `Content-Type` overrides the default (which is now only applied when a body is sent and the user didn't set one).
  - `timeout` — request timeout in seconds (default **60**, was 10; connect capped at 30).
  - `full` — when `true`, returns a `<string, any>` dict `{ status, ok, statusText, headers, body }` and does **not** throw on HTTP status, so 4xx/5xx (404, 429, 529, …) can be inspected. `headers` is a `<string, any>` dict keyed by lowercased name; a missing key reads as `null`.
  - `binary` — when `true`, the body is returned as a byte array `[int]` (0-255) instead of a UTF-8 string, so images / zips / PDFs download intact. Decode with `Binary.toUtf8` / `Binary.toHex`.
  - Default (no options) behaviour is unchanged: returns the body string and throws on status ≥ 400 — now with the response body embedded in the thrown message instead of just the status code.
  - Any HTTP method is accepted (incl. HEAD/OPTIONS) via `Agent::request`. Arguments are sniffed by type: the first string after the url is the method, the second is the body, and a dict is the options — so `fetch(url, opts)`, `fetch(url, "POST", opts)` and `fetch(url, "POST", body, opts)` all work. 100% backward compatible; `native fn` declarations are unaffected.
  - Implemented in `src/evaluator/builtins.rs` (`eval_fetch` + `fetch_make_value`).

### Test count

- 309 passing (0 failing) — added `43_fetch_full_e2e`, `44_fetch_binary_e2e`, `sec_fetch_header_injection`.

---

## [3.8.4] — branch `improve`

### Tooling / diagnostics

- **Arena stats** — `Evaluator::arena_stats()` returns the current object-slot counts of the two arenas `(global, scoped)`. When the program is run with the environment variable `SEREZ_ARENA_STATS` set, a line `[arena] global=N scoped=M` is printed to stderr at exit. Read-only diagnostic for measuring memory behaviour of the Region-Based Memory (e.g. confirming that scoped loops stay flat and which patterns promote to the never-freed global arena). **Not a GC and not an optimization** — zero runtime overhead unless the env var is set (a single `env::var` lookup at exit). Used to characterize the closure/escaping-container promotion-to-global behaviour (documented; the GUI memory discipline belongs to serez-ui, not the core).

---

## [3.8.3] — branch `improve`

### Bug fixes

- **B-84** — Parenthesized single-parameter arrow lambda failed to parse. `(x => body)` raised `Expected ')' in grouped expression`, even though `(x) => body`, bare `x => body`, and `(a, b) => body` all parsed. After consuming `(` and a leading identifier, the parser matched `,` (multi-param), `)` (`(a)`/`(a) => …`) and a catch-all that assumed a grouped expression — so a following `=>` (Arrow) was never recognized. Added an explicit `Arrow` arm that parses `( ident => body )` as a parenthesized single-param lambda. This unblocks common forms like `5 |> (x => x * 2)`, `((x => x + 1))(5)`, and `let f = (x => …)`. New regression: `unit_paren_lambda` (6 cases). Found while fuzzing pipe/lambda syntax.

### Test count

- 306 passing (0 failing) — added `unit_paren_lambda`.

---

## [3.8.2] — branch `improve`

### Bug fixes

- **B-83** — Inconsistent lambda capture: scope-dependent snapshot vs. live reference. Lambdas snapshot scoped locals (`capture_env` extracts + plants them to the global arena at creation), but variables referenced from a lambda that live in the **global** arena (top-level `let`s) were resolved *live* at call time. So the exact same lambda captured locals by value but globals by reference, depending only on where it was written: `let x=10; let f=()=>x; x=20; f()` gave `20` at top level but `10` inside a function; `while (i<3){ fns.push(()=>i); i=i+1 }` gave `3 3 3` at top level but `0 1 2` inside a function. Fixed with `capture_lambda_env`: in addition to the existing local snapshot, a best-effort free-identifier walk of the lambda body now also snapshots referenced **global data variables** at creation. Global **functions** are intentionally skipped (kept live) so recursion and late binding keep working. The walk only ever *adds* snapshots — an unhandled construct simply degrades to the previous live-lookup behavior, so it cannot break a valid closure (the whole suite is unchanged). New regression: `45_closure_capture_e2e`.

### Test count

- 305 passing (0 failing) — added `45_closure_capture_e2e`.

---

## [3.8.1] — branch `improve`

### Bug fixes

- **B-82** — Nested arrays corrupted when reassigning an outer-scope variable from inside a nested block. The shared scoped arena is a single stack rewound on block exit (`pop` → `reset_to`). A plain variable assignment (`x = value`) stored a *shallow* clone of the value's `ObjectData`: for an array/dict/set it copied the inner `ObjectRef`s, which could point into a deeper block's region. When that inner block popped, the inner refs dangled — the container's `.length()` stayed correct but indexing an element read a truncated/reused slot (symptom: `is array` == false, "Index operator not supported"). `push`/index-assign/dict-value-assign already promoted to the global arena at `depth > 1`, but plain variable assignment was missed. Fixed by `promote_container_for_assign`: when assigning a heap container (Array/Dict/Set) to a variable from inside a nested scope, the value is deep-promoted to the global arena so its elements outlive inner-block pops. Scalars and instances (fields are `OwnedValue`) are untouched — no effect on loop counters like `i = i + 1`. Found while building serez-ui's `.szs` CSS parser. New regression: `unit_nested_array_assign` (4 cases).

### Test count

- 303 passing (0 failing) — added `unit_nested_array_assign`.

---

## [2.1.0] — branch `improve`

### New features

**Fase 1 — Memory namespace: raw byte heap**

- `Memory` namespace: `sizeof`, `alloc`, `free`, `size`, `read`, `write`, `copy`, `fill`, `offsetOf`.
- `Memory.sizeof(type)` — returns byte-size of a primitive type name (`"int"`, `"bool"`, `"float32"`, etc.).
- `Memory.alloc(n)` → int handle — allocates `n` bytes of zeroed memory in a `HashMap<i64, Vec<u8>>` heap stored on the evaluator; requires `unsafe {}` block.
- `Memory.read(handle, offset, type)` / `Memory.write(handle, offset, type, value)` — typed read/write at a byte offset; require `unsafe {}`.
- `Memory.copy(src, dst, n)` — copies `n` bytes between two allocations; requires `unsafe {}`.
- `Memory.fill(handle, byte)` — fills an entire allocation with a byte value; requires `unsafe {}`.
- `Memory.offsetOf(class_name, field_name)` — returns word-aligned field offset (8-byte stride) by looking up the class registry.
- New evaluator fields: `memory_heap: HashMap<i64, Vec<u8>>`, `memory_heap_next_id: i64`.
- New source file: `src/evaluator/namespaces_memory.rs`.

**Fase 1.5 — unsafe as expression + new built-in globals**

- `unsafe { ... }` can now be used as an expression, enabling patterns like `let h = unsafe { Memory.alloc(64) }`. AST: `Expression::UnsafeBlock(BlockStatement)`. Parser: expression-level dispatch in `parse_expression`. Evaluator: delegates to `eval_unsafe_block`.
- `time()` built-in — returns current Unix timestamp in milliseconds as `int`.
- `env(name)` built-in — reads an environment variable by name; returns empty string if not set.
- `exit(code)` built-in — terminates the process with the given exit code (`std::process::exit`).
- `native fn` dispatch: when a declared native function is called but has no Rust implementation registered, a clear error is now printed.

**Fase 2 — Extended Tensor math**

- **Activation functions** (element-wise, return new Tensor): `relu`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `softmax`.
- **Element-wise math**: `abs`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `log`, `pow(exp)`.
- **Norms**: `norm()` (L2, default) / `norm(1)` (L1) — returns a Decimal.
- **Clamp**: `clamp(min, max)` — clips all elements to `[min, max]`.
- **Broadcast add**: `broadcastAdd(bias)` — adds a 1D tensor to each row of a 2D tensor `(m, n) + (n,)`.

### Bug fixes

- **B-75** — Keyword token as method name rejected by class parser: methods named `get`, `set`, or `static` (lexed as `KwGet`/`KwSet`/`KwStatic`) were unconditionally rejected by the `Ident`-only check in `parse_class_declaration`. Fixed by extracting `token_type_is_name()` helper and using `current_token_is_name()` at the method-name check point.
- **B-76** — `Tensor.sum()` on empty tensor returned `-0.0`: Rust's `Iterator::sum` initialises the accumulator with `0.0_f64` and produces negative zero on empty input. Fixed by adding an `is_empty()` early-return guard matching the pattern already used by `Tensor.mean()`.
- **B-65 assertion corrected** — `Math.round(-4.5)` returns `-5` (Rust "half away from zero"), not `-4`. Test expectation updated.
- **`unit_class_arch` assertion corrected** — `pts.find(p => p.sum() > 6)` returns the first match (x=3), not the last (x=5). Test expectation updated.

### New parser feature

- **Enum.Variant in match patterns** — `match dir { case Direction.North => ... }` now works. The parser detects `Ident.Ident` in match position and creates a `MatchPattern::Literal(DotCall)`, evaluated at runtime by the existing literal-pattern path.

### Test count

- 274 passing (0 failing) — added: `unit_memory`, `unit_native`, `unit_tensor_math`, `56_memory_e2e`, `57_tensor_math_e2e`, `unit_match_enum`, `unit_bug_b64_b74`, `unit_math_trig`, `unit_memory_offsetof`, `unit_tensor_ops`, `unit_set_ops` (extended), `unit_bug_b75_b76`, `unit_class_arch` (extended), `sec_memory_requires_unsafe`, `sec_memory_write_requires_unsafe`, `sec_memory_read_requires_unsafe`, `sec_memory_free_requires_unsafe`, `sec_json_invalid`, `59_integral2_e2e`.

## [2.0.2] — branch `improve`

### New features

**Fase 2.5 — serez-sec: Socket and Binary namespaces**

- `Socket` namespace: `connect`, `send`, `recv`, `close`, `listen`, `accept` — raw TCP over `std::net::TcpStream` / `TcpListener`. Socket IDs (int) stored in the evaluator's registry; usable from Serez code as `Socket.connect("host", port)`.
- `Binary` namespace: byte-array utilities — `fromHex`, `toHex`, `fromUtf8`, `toUtf8`, `packInt32Le`, `packInt32Be`, `unpackInt32Le`, `unpackInt32Be`, `packInt64Le`, `unpackInt64Le`, `concat`. All operate on Serez integer arrays (values 0–255).
- Tests: `tests/53_socket_e2e.sz`, `tests/unit_binary.sz`, `tests/unit_socket.sz` (42 new test cases).

**Fase 4 — GPU compute (CPU-backed)**

- `GPU` namespace: `createBuffer`, `createBufferFromArray`, `readBuffer`, `freeBuffer`, `fill`, `size`, `map`, `reduce`, `dot`, `axpy`, `matmul`. Buffers are flat `Vec<f64>` stored in the evaluator. API mirrors GPU compute patterns (create/upload/dispatch/readback/free) so a future backend can swap to real GPU calls with no language changes.
- Tests: `tests/54_gpu_e2e.sz`, `tests/unit_gpu.sz` (13 new test cases).

**Fase 6 — Package manager**

- `src/package_manager.rs`: `SerezManifest` JSON parser (hand-rolled, no external crate), `install_package(spec)`, `install_all()`, `packages_dir()` / `registry_dir()` (support `SEREZ_PACKAGES` / `SEREZ_REGISTRY` env vars for testing).
- `sz install [pkg@version]` CLI subcommand: without argument reads `serez.json` and installs all dependencies; with argument installs a specific package from the registry.
- Import resolution now searches `packages_dir()` (and falls back to `~/.serez/packages/`) after all existing search paths. Also supports `<pkg>/index.sz` layout so `import "pkg-name"` resolves to `packages/pkg-name/index.sz`.
- `run_tests.ps1` / `run_tests.sh`: set `SEREZ_PACKAGES=tests/packages` so package tests run correctly against local test packages.
- Tests: `tests/55_packages_e2e.sz`, `tests/unit_packages.sz` (13 new test cases). Test packages: `tests/packages/math-helpers/`, `tests/packages/string-tools/`.
- Rust unit tests in `package_manager.rs` verify manifest parsing and pkg-spec parsing.

### Test count

- 214 → 256 passing (0 failing).

## [2.0.1] — branch `improve`

### Bug fixes

**B-64 — `abs(i64::MIN)` overflow** (`src/evaluator/builtins.rs`)
- Before: called `.abs()` on `i64::MIN` — overflows in release mode (|i64::MIN| > i64::MAX).
- Now: uses `i64::checked_abs()` — returns an error for `i64::MIN`.

**B-65 — `floor` / `ceil` / `round` / `trunc` UB on non-finite f64** (`src/evaluator/builtins.rs`)
- Before: casting `f64::INFINITY`, `f64::NEG_INFINITY`, or `f64::NAN` to `i64` via `as i64` is undefined behavior in Rust.
- Now: each function validates `!v.is_nan() && !v.is_infinite()` before casting.

**B-66 — `Math.random()` only produced values in `[0, ~0.5)`** (`src/evaluator/namespaces.rs`)
- Before: LCG state shifted right 33 bits (31-bit range `[0, 2³¹)`) divided by `u32::MAX` (2³²−1) — maximum ≈ 0.5.
- Now: divides by `1u64 << 31` to produce the documented `[0, 1.0)` range.

**B-67 — `asin` / `acos` accepted out-of-domain arguments** (`src/evaluator/builtins.rs`)
- Before: any `f64` was accepted — inputs outside `[-1, 1]` silently produced `NaN`.
- Now: validates `v >= -1.0 && v <= 1.0` before calling the intrinsic.

**B-68 — `JSON.stringify` emitted invalid JSON for `NaN` / `Infinity`** (`src/evaluator/mod.rs`)
- Before: non-finite `f64` values were formatted with Rust's `Display`, producing `"inf"`, `"-inf"`, or `"NaN"`.
- Now: `if !d.is_finite() { return "null".to_string(); }` per the JSON specification.

**B-69 — `call_function` (map / filter / sort callbacks) rejected default and rest parameters** (`src/evaluator/mod.rs`)
- Before: arity checked as `arg_count != params.len()` and parameters bound via `args[i]` direct indexing.
- Now: computes `required_count`, checks `arg_count >= required` with upper bound for non-rest, binds defaults and collects rest parameter into an array.

**B-70 — `min_params` formula wrong for functions with default + rest parameters** (`src/evaluator/expr.rs`)
- Before: `if has_rest { params.len() - 1 } else { required_count }` — gives wrong count when both rest and defaults are present.
- Now: `let min_params = required_count` in all cases.

**B-71 — `super()` constructor call rejected default and rest parameters** (`src/evaluator/classes.rs`)
- Before: `eval_super_call` used strict arity and `args[i]` direct indexing.
- Now: same default/rest parameter handling as `call_function`.

**B-72 — `new ClassName()` constructor call rejected default and rest parameters** (`src/evaluator/classes.rs`)
- Before: `eval_new_class` used strict arity and direct indexing for constructor binding.
- Now: same default/rest parameter handling.

**B-73 — `super.method()` call rejected default and rest parameters** (`src/evaluator/classes.rs`)
- Before: `eval_super_method_call` used strict arity.
- Now: same default/rest parameter handling.

**B-74 — `invoke_method` rest parameter not collected** (`src/evaluator/classes.rs`)
- Before: parameter binding loop did not handle rest parameters — extra arguments beyond the last named param were silently discarded.
- Now: rest parameter is collected from `args[i..]` into an `Array` and declared in scope.

### Version

- `Cargo.toml`: `2.0.0` → `2.0.1`

---

## [2.0.0] — branch `improve`

### Breaking changes

**`pop()` on empty array is now a runtime error (Bug 1)**
- Before: returned `null` silently
- Now: `❌ ERROR: pop() called on an empty array`
- Rationale: silent null masked logic bugs where callers expected a real value

**`shift()` on empty array is now a runtime error (Bug 2)**
- Before: returned `null` silently
- Now: `❌ ERROR: shift() called on an empty array`
- Rationale: same as pop() — silent null was undetectable

**`2 ** 63` and exponent overflow are now runtime errors (Bug 3)**
- Before: f64 precision caused `2 ** 63` to silently return `i64::MAX` instead of detecting overflow
- Now: uses `i64::checked_pow` — exact overflow detection with no floating-point rounding
- Now: `❌ ERROR: Integer overflow in exponentiation`
- Base 0, 1, -1 at any exponent are still handled correctly (no overflow possible)
- Decimal exponent path (`2 ** 63.0`) is unchanged — goes through `f64::powf`

**Typed dict missing key is now a runtime error (Bug 4)**
- Before: `d["missing"]` on a `<K, V>` dict (V ≠ `any`) silently returned `null`
- Now: `❌ ERROR: Key 'missing' not found in typed dict <_, V>`
- Untyped dicts (`<K, any>`) still return `null` for missing keys — no change

### Distribution

- **Release pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow builds binaries for Windows x64, Linux x64 (static musl), macOS ARM64, macOS x64 on every version tag and publishes them to GitHub Releases
- **`install.sh`**: one-line installer for Linux and macOS — auto-detects OS and arch, installs to `~/.local/bin/sz`
- **`install.ps1`**: one-line installer for Windows — downloads to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SerezCode\bin\sz.exe` and adds to user PATH
- **CI workflow** (`ci.yml`): builds on `main` and `integration` on every push and pull request

### Tests (214 total, 0 failures)

- `41_bug_fixes_e2e.sz` — E2E integration test covering all 4 bug fixes (Queue, SafeStack, safePow2, Registry, game loop)
- `unit_bug_fixes.sz` — 21 unit tests for positive regression across all 4 fixes
- `sec_pop_empty_array.sz`, `sec_shift_empty_array.sz`, `sec_typed_dict_miss_key.sz`, `sec_power_2_63.sz` — security tests verifying each fix produces the correct error
- `unit_sec_pentest_bugs.sz` — 16 penetration tests with boundary exhaustion, alternating cycles, power edge cases, dict key patterns
- `run_tests.ps1` — new `-cli` flag runs 12 tests covering CLI flags (`--version`, unknown flags, non-.sz), REPL behavior (arithmetic, variable persistence, function definition, error recovery), and `--check` mode output

### Native backend (foundation — not yet connected to runtime)

- `src/compiler/types.rs` — compile-time type system (`SzType`) mapping Serez types to LLVM types
- `src/compiler/hir.rs` + `hir_lower.rs` — AST → HIR lowering with full desugar pass
- `src/compiler/mir.rs` + `mir_lower.rs` — HIR → MIR three-address code with basic blocks
- `src/compiler/llvm_emit.rs` — MIR → LLVM IR text emission (74 tests passing)

---

## [1.0.0] — VS Code formatter and CI

### VS Code — Formatter (`vscode-serez` v0.2.0)

**`extension.js`** — new `DocumentFormattingEditProvider`:
- Auto-indentation with 4 spaces per level, based on `{` and `}` counting
- Ignores braces inside string literals and line comments (`//`)
- `} else {` handled correctly: dedent before printing, indent after
- Collapses consecutive blank lines into one
- Removes trailing whitespace from all lines
- File always ends with exactly one `\n`

**`package.json`** — version `0.2.0`:
- `"main": "./extension.js"` and `"activationEvents": ["onLanguage:serez"]`
- `Formatters` category added
- `configurationDefaults` for `.sz`: `editor.defaultFormatter` and `editor.formatOnSave: true` enabled automatically

**Usage:** `Shift+Alt+F` to format manually, or save the file (formatOnSave).  
**Rebuild:** `vsce package` in `vscode-serez/` generates `serez-code-0.2.0.vsix`.

---

### CI / Tooling
- `release.yml`: permissions scoped per job — only `host` has `contents: write`; others have `contents: read`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: automatic weekly updates for GitHub Actions and Cargo dependencies
- `run_tests.sh`: Bash script equivalent to `run_tests.ps1`, with `--filter`, `--generate`, `--unit`, `--e2e`, `--security` flags; ANSI colors; CRLF normalization; unique temp files per process
- Evaluator refactored from a single `evaluator.rs` (5300+ lines) to 12 submodules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | Main entry, Flash Scope protocol, StoredMethod cache, static profiler |
| `stmt.rs` | Statement evaluation (let, assign, for, while, return, …) |
| `expr.rs` | Expression evaluation (calls, index, dot, ternary, …) |
| `ops.rs` | Infix and prefix operators |
| `check.rs` | Type-check helpers (parameters, return, typed arrays) |
| `builtins.rs` | Global functions (parseInt, parseDecimal, readLine, …) |
| `classes.rs` | Instantiation, method dispatch, inheritance, super |
| `methods_array.rs` | Array methods (push, pop, map, filter, reduce, sort, …) |
| `methods_string.rs` | String methods (split, replace, trim, padStart, …) |
| `methods_set.rs` | Set methods (add, has, delete, toArray, union, …) |
| `namespaces.rs` | Built-in namespaces (Math, File, JSON) |
| `control.rs` | Control flow helpers (break, continue, labeled loops, do-while) |

### Demo apps
- `apps/01_task_manager.sz` — enum, inheritance, static methods, switch, HOF, try/catch
- `apps/02_statistics.sz` — typed arrays, Math, map/filter/reduce, Pearson correlation
- `apps/03_text_analyzer.sz` — string methods, dicts, Caesar cipher, File I/O
- `apps/04_bank_system.sz` — abstract class, sealed, interface, const, getters, optional chaining
- `apps/05_data_pipeline.sz` — JSON, File, Set, bitwise/power ops, pipeline HOF

## [0.1.0] — Language history

### Phase 5 — Bug fixes and semantics (B-62 to B-63)

**`reverse()` — in-place mutation with return (B-62)**
- Before: `reverse()` returned void, was not chainable
- Now: mutates the array in-place AND returns the same array — allows `let sorted = arr.reverse()`

**`trimLeft` / `trimRight` as aliases (B-63)**
- Added as aliases for `trimStart` / `trimEnd` for compatibility

---

### Phase 4 — Critical bug fixes (B-54 to B-61)

**`is` operator — full fix (B-61)**
- Bug: `is` was tokenized as an identifier, never worked as an infix operator
- Fix: `KwIs` token added; registered in `token_precedence()` and in the parser's `is_infix` match; `eval_infix` handler added in the evaluator
- `null is null` also fixed: missing case `("null", ObjectData::Null)` in `type_matches`

**Named function capture semantics (B-58)**
- Before: `fn` declarations captured the value at definition time (snapshot)
- Now: `fn` declarations use reference semantics — rebind of the shared global slot
- Lambdas maintain snapshot semantics (no changes)
- `ScopeStack::rebind()` added for selective rebinding of outer scope

**Dict mutation from nested scope (B-57)**
- Bug: arena lifetime — a new entry in a dict mutated from inside a function stayed in the local scope and was destroyed on exit
- Fix: `plant_global` used when `depth > 1`

**`padStart` / `padEnd` — incorrect early return (B-56)**
- Bug: if the string already had the target length, it returned empty instead of returning the original string
- Fix: early return corrected

**Shift validation (B-55)**
- `1 << 64` and `8 >> -1` were silently incorrect
- Now they are runtime errors: negative or ≥ 64 shift throws an error

**`flat(n)` — depth parameter (B-54)**
- Before: only supported `flat()` with depth 1
- Now: `flat(n)` recursively flattens `n` levels; `flat()` is equivalent to `flat(1)`

**Getter-only — write error (B-53)**
- Attempting to assign to a property that only has `get` (without `set`) is now a runtime error

---

### Phase 3 — New language features

#### Operators

**Power operator `**`**
- `2 ** 10` → `1024`; works with `int` and `decimal`
- Higher precedence than `*` / `/` / `%`
- `0 ** 0` → `1` (mathematical convention)

**Bitwise operators**
- `&` AND, `|` OR, `^` XOR, `~` NOT (prefix), `<<` left shift, `>>` arithmetic right shift
- Only for `int` (64-bit signed, two's complement)
- Negative or ≥ 64 shift is a runtime error
- Binary (`0b1010`) and hexadecimal (`0xFF`) literals supported
- Numeric separators: `1_000_000`, `0xFF_FF`

**Optional chaining `?.`**
- `obj?.method()` / `obj?.field` — if `obj` is `null`, returns `null` without error
- Chainable: `a?.getNext()?.getValue() ?? 0`
- Combinable with `??` for fallback

#### Control flow

**`do-while`**
- The body executes at least once
- `break` and `continue` work the same as in `while`/`for`

#### Classes

**Static methods**
- `public static T method(args)` in classes
- Called as `ClassName.method(args)` — no instance required
- No access to `this`

**Parameters with default values**
- `fn int add(int a, int b = 10)` — if the caller omits the argument, the default is used
- The default is an arbitrary expression evaluated at call time
- The type checker handles variable arity (skip if there are defaults)

**Abstract classes**
- `abstract class Foo` — not directly instantiable; runtime error on `new`
- Methods without a body declared for override in subclasses

**Sealed classes**
- `sealed class Foo` — not inheritable; attempting to extend it is a runtime error

**Getters and setters**
- `public get T prop()` — called automatically when reading `obj.prop` (without parentheses)
- `public set prop(T val)` — called automatically when assigning `obj.prop = val`
- Property with only getter is read-only; writing to it is a runtime error

**Class fields with default values**
- `field: type = value` in the class body

#### Arrays — new methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `.find(cb)` | First element where `cb` returns `true`, or `null` |
| `.findIndex(cb)` | Index of the first element matching the predicate, or `-1` |
| `.every(cb)` | `true` if `cb` is `true` for all elements |
| `.some(cb)` | `true` if `cb` is `true` for at least one |
| `.slice(start, end)` | New array from `start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive) |
| `.flat(n?)` | Flattens `n` nesting levels (default 1) |
| `.reverse()` | Reverses in-place, returns the same array |
| `.indexOf(val)` | Index of the first occurrence, or `-1` |
| `.includes(val)` | `true` if the array contains the value |
| `.remove(idx)` | Removes and returns the element at `idx` |

#### Strings — new methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `.padStart(n, ch?)` | Pads the start with `ch` (default space) up to length `n` |
| `.padEnd(n, ch?)` | Pads the end with `ch` (default space) up to length `n` |
| `.slice(start, end?)` | Substring with negative index support |
| `.trimStart()` / `.trimLeft()` | Removes leading whitespace |
| `.trimEnd()` / `.trimRight()` | Removes trailing whitespace |
| `.toUpperCase()` / `.upper()` | Uppercase copy |
| `.toLowerCase()` / `.lower()` | Lowercase copy |
| `.startsWith(prefix)` | `true` if the string starts with `prefix` |
| `.endsWith(suffix)` | `true` if the string ends with `suffix` |
| `.charAt(i)` | Character at position `i`, or `""` if out of range |
| `.indexOf(sub)` | Index of first occurrence of `sub`, or `-1` |
| `.replace(from, to)` | Replaces **all** occurrences (previously only the first) |

---

### Phase 2 — Stdlib and compound types

#### `const`
- `const PI = 3.14159` — immutable; any reassignment is a runtime error
- Same scoping as `let` — invisible outside its block

#### `enum`
- `enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }` — variants accessed as `Color.Red`
- Variants are their own type (not `string`) — do not annotate enum parameters as `string`
- Comparable with `==` and usable in `switch case`
- Displayed as `"Color.Red"` (fully qualified name)

#### Labeled loops
- `outer: for (...)` + `break outer` / `continue outer`
- Works with `while`, `for`, `for-in`, `do-while`

#### Spread and rest
- Spread in array literals: `[...arr, 1, 2]`
- Spread in calls: `fn(...args)`
- Rest params: `fn void log(...args)` — `args` is an array with all extra arguments
- The type checker skips arity checks for functions with rest params

#### Namespace `Math`

| Function/Constant | Description |
|---|---|
| `Math.PI`, `Math.E` | Mathematical constants |
| `Math.abs(x)` | Absolute value |
| `Math.floor(x)`, `Math.ceil(x)`, `Math.round(x)`, `Math.trunc(x)` | Rounding (return `int`) |
| `Math.sqrt(x)` | Square root |
| `Math.pow(base, exp)` | Power |
| `Math.exp(x)`, `Math.log(x)`, `Math.log2(x)`, `Math.log10(x)` | Exponential and logarithms |
| `Math.sin(x)`, `Math.cos(x)`, `Math.tan(x)` | Trigonometric (radians) |
| `Math.asin(x)`, `Math.acos(x)`, `Math.atan(x)`, `Math.atan2(y, x)` | Inverse trigonometric |
| `Math.min(a, b, ...)`, `Math.max(a, b, ...)` | Variadic min/max |
| `Math.clamp(x, min, max)` | Clamp to range `[min, max]` |
| `Math.sign(x)` | Returns `1`, `0`, or `-1` |
| `Math.random()` | Pseudo-random decimal in `[0, 1)` (LCG) |

#### Namespace `File`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `File.exists(path)` | `true` if the file exists |
| `File.read(path)` | File contents as `string` |
| `File.write(path, content)` | Writes/overwrites the file |
| `File.create(path)` | Creates empty file if not exists (touch, idempotent) |
| `File.read_asBinary(path)` | File bytes as `[int]` (0–255 each) |
| `File.write_asBinary(path, bytes)` | Writes byte array to file |

#### Namespace `JSON`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `JSON.stringify(value)` | Serializes any value to a JSON string |
| `JSON.parse(string)` | Parses a JSON string; runtime error if invalid |

#### `Set` type

| Method/property | Description |
|---|---|
| `new Set()`, `new Set([...])` | Creates empty set or initialized from array (no duplicates) |
| `.size` | Element count (property, without parentheses) |
| `.add(val)` | Inserts `val` if not present (mutates in-place) |
| `.has(val)` / `.contains(val)` | `true` if the set contains `val` |
| `.delete(val)` / `.remove(val)` | Removes `val`, returns `true` if it existed |
| `.clear()` | Removes all elements |
| `.toArray()` | Returns all elements as an array |
| `.union(other)` | New set with all elements from both |
| `.intersection(other)` | New set with only elements present in both |

---

### Phase 1 — Language core

#### Variables and types
- `let x = value` — declaration; `x = value` — reassignment (without `let`)
- Primitive types: `int` (i64), `decimal` (f64), `bool`, `string`, `void`, `any`, `null`
- Compound types: array `[T]`, dict `<K,V>`, function, interface, class instance
- Nullable types: `int?`, `string?` — accept the base type or `null`
- Typed arrays: `let nums [int] = [1, 2, 3]` — type enforced on push, unshift, index-assign
- Type inference: `let x = add(1, 2)` infers `x: int` in the static checker

#### Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (integer, truncates), `%`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!` (short-circuit)
- Ternary: `cond ? then : else` (lazy, right-associative)
- Null coalescing: `a ?? b`
- `is`: `expr is TypeName` — `true`/`false` at runtime
- Compound assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- Increment/decrement: `++`, `--` (prefix and postfix, as statements only)
- String repetition: `"ha" * 3` → `"hahaha"`
- Concatenation: `"x" + 42` → `"x42"`

#### Runtime safety
- Integer overflow: `checked_*` — error instead of silent wrap
- Division/modulus by zero: runtime error
- Out-of-range index: runtime error
- Undeclared variable: runtime error
- `return` outside a function: runtime error
- Stack overflow: runtime error (not catchable via try/catch)

#### Functions
- Declared: `fn returnType name(type param) { ... }`
- Arrow: `let f = returnType (type param) => { ... }`
- Anonymous: `let f = fn void () { ... }`
- First-class: assignable to variables, passable as arguments
- Recursive: supported with call stack in errors
- Lexical closures: capture variables from the scope where they are defined
- `fn` declarations: reference semantics (rebind of global slot)
- Lambdas (`x => expr`): snapshot semantics (capture by value)

#### Control flow
- `if` / `else if` / `else` — condition in parentheses, braces required
- `while` — condition in parentheses
- `for` — `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` — update accepts `i++`, `i--`, `i+=n`, etc.
- `for-in` — `for (let x in arr)` iterates array or string; `x` is a copy of the element
- `break` / `continue` — in all loops
- `switch` — no fall-through; `case a, b:` for multiple values; `default:`
- `try` / `catch(e)` / `finally` — `finally` always runs; `throw` accepts any value
- Standalone blocks `{ ... }` — create new Flash Scope

#### Arrays
- Literals: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[]`
- Index access: `arr[i]` (0-based)
- Index mutation: `arr[i] = val`
- Global mutation from function: `data[i] = val` persists; `this.arr[i] = val` persists
- **Limitation**: `for-in` creates a copy — mutating the loop variable does not affect the original array
- Mutation methods: `.push`, `.pop`, `.shift`, `.unshift`, `.reverse`, `.sort`, `.sort("desc")`, `.sort((a,b) => ...)`
- Query methods: `.length`, `.join`, `.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce`

#### Strings
- Interpolation: `"Hello {name}!"` — supports complex expressions inside `{}`
- `\{` for literal brace; `\"` inside `{...}` breaks the parser (use a variable)
- Escape sequences: `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\"`, `\{`
- Methods: `.length`, `.substring`, `.split`, `.replace`, `.includes`, `.trim`, `.toString()`

#### Dictionaries
- `let d <string,int> = ({"a",1},{"b",2})`
- Access: `d["key"]` — returns `null` if the key does not exist (no error)
- Write: `d["key"] = val` or `d.Add({"key",val})`
- Methods: `.Add`, `.Remove`, `.RemoveAll`, `.clear`, `.toList`, `.toArray`

#### Classes and interfaces
- `interface Point { x: decimal, y: decimal }` — typed field record, no methods
- `class Foo { public Foo(args) { ... } }` — constructor + fields + methods
- Single inheritance: `class Bar : Foo { ... }`, `super(args)` in constructor
- `public` / `private` — `private` only accessible from methods of the same class
- Instance: `let obj = new Foo(args)`
- Field mutation: `obj.field = val`
- **Limitation**: `this.field[i].method()` inside a class method creates a copy — the result does not persist; use `this.field[i] = newValue` instead

#### Conversions and I/O
- `parseInt(val)` — converts to `int` (string, decimal, int)
- `parseDecimal(val)` — converts to `decimal` (string, int, decimal)
- `readLine(prompt?)` — reads a line from stdin
- `out expr` — prints to stdout with newline; statement, not function

#### Memory — Flash Scopes
- Two arenas: global (entire program) and scoped (local per block)
- Each `{ }` records a watermark on entry and truncates on exit — O(k) per scope
- Return values extracted as `OwnedValue` before the pop and replanted in the parent scope
- `Rc<BlockStatement>` for function bodies — cloning a function is O(1)
- `StoredMethod` in classes — O(1) dispatch without cloning the method body

#### Tooling
- `sz script.sz` — execute file
- `sz` — REPL
- `sz --check script.sz` — static profiler (byte estimation per function)
- `sz --watch script.sz` — automatic rerun on save
- `sz --version` — version
- Span errors: line + column + caret `^` in source
- VS Code extension: syntax highlighting for `.sz`
